terraform can output the attributes of a resource with the output values

this can be helpful just to out the valuable information or feed the information to external software

An outputed attributes can not only be used for the user reference but it can also be act as input other resource created via terraform

Ex:- Use "output" to display the public ip address of an AWS resource

resource "aws_instance" "jenkinsServer" {
  ami           = "ami-0ebc1ac48dfd14136" // AMI id inside above mentioned region
  instance_type = "t2.micro" // instance type
}

output "publicIp"{
    value = "${aws_instance.jenkinsServer.public_ip}"
}

you can refer any attribute with the following elements

aws_instance ===> resource type
jenkinsServer==> resource name
public_ip ==> attribute name


you can also use the attributes in script, useful for instance to start automation scripts after infrastructure provisioned
