if version is not specified explicitly then during terraform init , 
the most recent provider plugin will be downloaded.

sometime in product environment, you need to mention version explicitly to ensure due new version it will break exist code

if you want set version you can do it configuration level explicitly.


version    = "2.7"  ==> download specified version
version    = ">= 2.8"  ==> greater than equal to specified version
version    = "<= 2.8"  ==> lessthan than equal to specified version
version    = ">=2.10,<=2.30" ==> between 2.10 to 2.30 version plugin will downloaded
version    = "~>2.0" ==> any version in the 2.X range.

sometime provider version compatability will come due to terraform version.
make sure corect version mentioned inside .tf file
