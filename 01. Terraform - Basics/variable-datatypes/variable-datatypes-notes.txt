the type argument in a variable block allows you to restrict the type of value

Ex:

variable "instance_type"{
    type = string
}

in above example we are restricting the value of instance_type as type string. so other datatype not allowed.
if we do, it shows error at terraform execution.

if no type defined, any type of value accepted...
